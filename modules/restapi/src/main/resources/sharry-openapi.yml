  title: Sharry
  version: 1.6.0-SNAPSHOT
  description: |
    Sharry provides a way to share files with others in a convenient
    way. The core functionality is provided by a server that can be
    controlled via REST calls.

    The calls are divided into 4 categories:

    - `/open/*`: no authentication is required to access
    - `/sec/*`: an authenticated user is required
    - `/alias/*`: these routes are allowed with a valid *alias id*
      given as header `Sharry-Alias`
    - `/admin/*`: an authenticated user that is admin is required

    Authentication works by logging in with username/password (or an
    oauth2 flow) that generates a token that has to be sent with every
    request to a secured and admin route. It is possible to sent it
    via a `Cookie` header or the special `Sharry-Auth` header.

    Files can be uploaded using different methods. There is an
    endpoint that can take all files and meta data from one single
    request. For more reliable uploads, the server implements the [tus
    protocol](https://tus.io/protocols/resumable-upload.html) that
    allows to resume failed or paused uploads.

        This only works, if sharry uses TLS (https), and the correct
        callback-url is configured at the provider.

        removed from the account.

        The password can be changed for an account. If it is `null` or
        empty, it is left unchanged. Also, if the account is not
        internal, a given password is ignored.

        Create a new (empty) file via tus' *creation* extension.

        This follows the tus protocol, but uses different headers for
        transporting the filename and filetype. While the tus protocol
        defines a `Upload-Metadata` header, what it can contain is not
        specified. It requires custom negotiation between server and
        client, so we can as well use different headers that are
        easier to read and write:

        - `Sharry-File-Name` specifies the filename (percent-encoded)
        - `Sharry-File-Type` specifies the content type
        - `Sharry-File-Length` can be used to specifiy the total
          length in bytes. If not found `Upload-Length` is used.

        The total length must be specified, name and content type are
        optional.
